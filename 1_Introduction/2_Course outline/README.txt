* Course Outline
================
	- Course title: "Learn Professional C++ | Introduction to the Boost C++ Libraries"
	- Duration: 7 hrs+
	- Boost C++ is a set of libraries with much more detailed & simplified function in addition to ISO C++ Standard libraries.
	- In fact, much of the features have been taken from Boost lib & incorporated into ISO C++ library.
	- In this course, there will be no series 2 (with same name), bcoz there will be continuous addition of new programs.
	- As this course is for lifetime access as per the platform's membership policy, so no problem in there.
	- Topics covered:
	   + Assertion: BOOST_ASSERT(), BOOST_ASSERT_MSG(), BOOST_VERIFY(), BOOST_VERIFY_MSG()
	   + Assign: +=, insert(), push_front(), list_of(), map_list_of(), tuple_list_of()
	   + Container:
		- vector: element each of 1, 2, multiple
		- list: element each of 1, 2, multiple
	   	- deque: element each of 1, 2, multiple
		- set: element each of 1, 2, multiple
		- map: element of 2
		- multimap: element of 2
		- multiset: element each of 1, 2, multiple
		- stack: element each of 1, 2, multiple
	   + String: conversion, erase, trim, replace, split
	- Applications using C++:
	   + Blockchain (EOS)
	   + Data Science
		- write faster code: C++ (definitely for Codebases)
		- write code fast: python (NOT for Codebase)
	   + GUI (using Qt)
